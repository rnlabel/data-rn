## A Long Night, A Song, and Someone Somewhere

Sitting in the back of a cab, shades on, hands still freezing from the cold. An old melody hums in my ears, but the feeling never gets old. The city stays the same, the sun still shines through my window, but this time, it welcomes someone stepping into my driveway.

I always wonder if the world has enough space for a mind like yours—a mind the world needs but never truly appreciates. We’ve been through storms, through lost memories and unwanted goodbyes. And somehow, someday, I know we’ll meet again. Maybe not now, but eventually.

I remember the long nights, just me and the quiet music. Everything that once felt familiar is now just fragments of a past life. We used to run free, like wildflowers in an open field. And I can’t help but wonder—what’s your wildest memory?

I pour myself a cup of tea, take a sip, and smile. Maybe I’m dreaming, or maybe this is just a slow-release dream, floating on the waves of Mercury. But one thing I know for sure—this love has never had conditions, never had an end. And no matter how many seasons pass, I’ll still be waiting to see you again.

> Soon, it won’t just be my story. It’ll be yours too. Stay tuned.
