# The Journey of Founding nrLabel

## A Chance Encounter

On an unremembered day in 2018, I happened to meet Tracy Pham when she was still in high school. We connected through our shared passion for music, and from there, I had the opportunity to collaborate with Tracy on many of her school projects. Simple recording sessions and deeply emotional songs became the first building blocks of a long journey ahead.

## The Formation of nrLabel

After years of collaboration and growth, we have officially founded a recording label called **nrLabel**. This is not just a place to create music but also a community where artistic souls can freely express themselves, create, and develop.

### Core Members

nrLabel currently features the following key members:

-   **Nam Pham** - Producer
    
-   **Tracy Pham** - Producer, Artist
    
-   **NÃ ng** - R&B Artist
    
-   **BlvckRain** - Rapper
    

Each member brings their own unique style, adding to the diversity and richness of the music we pursue.

## Vision and Future

nrLabel is not just focused on music production but also aims to build an ecosystem that supports young artists, helping them grow and establish their names in the music industry. We believe that with passion and dedication, nrLabel will continue to thrive and deliver the highest quality music to our audience.

This journey has only just begun, and we hope to have more people join nrLabel on the road ahead.
